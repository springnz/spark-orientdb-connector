# Spark OrientDB Connector

This library allows you to:

- access OrientDB classes as Spark RDDs
- access OrientDB graphs as GraphX graphs
- write RDDs to OrientDB
- write GraphX graphs to OrientDB

leveraging a co-located hybrid Spark/OrientDB cluster.

## How to get started

### Prerequisites

- sbt 0.13.x
- an OrientDB instance or several instances in distributed mode
- a Spark cluster

### Download source code and build connector

Clone connector repository with the following git commands:

```shell
	git clone https://github.com/metreta/spark-orientdb-connector.git
	cd spark-orientdb-connector
	git checkout tags/<tag_version>
```

where `<tag version>` is the version compatible with your Spark and OrientDB clusters you can find in the [version list](docs/version_list.md).

Then build the connector with sbt:

```shell
	sbt package
```

The default behaviour is to build for Scala 2.10. To build for Scala 2.11, execute the following instead

```shell
	sbt -Dscala-2.11=true package
```

### Create an sbt project and add dependencies

Create a basic Spark sbt project, add the connector jar you just built to the /lib folder and then add the following dependencies to your build.sbt:

```scala
  libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
    "com.orientechnologies" % "orientdb-client" % "2.1.0",
    "com.tinkerpop.blueprints" % "blueprints-core" % "2.6.0",
    "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-core" % "1.5.1",
    "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-graphx" % "1.5.1"
    )
```

Don't forget to choose the appropriate library versions as listed in the [version list](docs/version_list.md).


### Set up example data in OrientDB

Define a class Person in your OrientDB instance:

```sql
CREATE CLASS Person EXTENDS V
CREATE PROPERTY Person.name string
CREATE PROPERTY Person.surname string
CREATE CLASS Friendship EXTENDS E
```

Insert some data to create a graph:
```sql
CREATE VERTEX Person SET name = 'John', surname = 'Doe'
CREATE VERTEX Person SET name = 'Mary', surname = 'Smith'
CREATE VERTEX Person SET name = 'Frank', surname = 'White'
CREATE VERTEX Person SET name = 'Lois', surname = 'Parker'

CREATE EDGE Friendship FROM (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name = 'John' and surname = 'Doe') TO (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name = 'Mary' and surname = 'Smith')
CREATE EDGE Friendship FROM (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name = 'John' and surname = 'Doe') TO (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name = 'Frank' and surname = 'White')
CREATE EDGE Friendship FROM (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name = 'Frank' and surname = 'White') TO (SELECT FROM Person WHERE name = 'Lois' and surname = 'Parker')
```

### Write an empty Spark app class

```scala
package com.mycompany.sparkorientdbdemo

import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
import org.apache.spark.SparkContext
import com.metreta.spark.orientdb.connector._

object Demo extends App{

// Spark app code

}

```


### Configure Spark context

Create a Spark configuration object and set OrientDB connector specific parameters  :

```scala
val conf = new SparkConf()
    .setMaster("local[*]")
    .setAppName("OrientDBConnectorTest")
    .set("spark.orientdb.clustermode", "remote")
    .set("spark.orientdb.connection.nodes", "x.x.x.x, y.y.y.y, z.z.z.z")
    .set("spark.orientdb.protocol", "remote")
    .set("spark.orientdb.dbname", "connector-test")
    .set("spark.orientdb.port", "2424")
    .set("spark.orientdb.user", "root")
    .set("spark.orientdb.password", "pAzzw0rd")
```

Now create a SparkContext:

```scala
val sc = new SparkContext(conf)
```

### Read and write data

Following OrientDB multi-model approach the connector allows to access OrientDB data from Spark and write them back to OrientDB in two ways:

- Document approach: read OrientDB classes as Spark RDD and write an RDD to an Orient class
- Graph approach: read an OrientDB database as a GraphX graph object and write it back into a an OrientDB database

Use the function `orientQuery` to get an RDD containing all the entries of an OrientDB class:

```scala
 	val rddPeople = sc.orientQuery("Person")
```

`rddPeople` is an object of OrientClassRDD type containing  all the entries from the `Person` class as OrientDocument objects, created from the raw ODocument objects. If you prefer to get the ODocuments instead, use the following function:

```scala
 	val rddPeople = sc.orientDocumentQuery("Person")
```

The function `saveToOrient` writes an RDD of case objects to an OrientDB class:

```scala
	rddMyPeople.saveToOrient("Person")
```

To get a GraphX graph object from an OrientDB database use the `orientGraph` function:

```scala
	val graphPeople = sc.orientGraph()
```
